# mydockerfiles

dockerfiles for several cryptocurrencies

- For litecoin I use uphold/litecoind
- For monero I use raboo/monero

For NOMP you could use canercandan/nomp

I used to put a `sleep infinity` at the end of my dockerfiles : it's for debug purpose, don't hesitate to remove it

Files are not named "Dockerfile", just rename them, and build them
